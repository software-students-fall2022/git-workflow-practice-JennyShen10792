# An Article on What has Changed in 20 Years of Software Engineering

https://technical.ly/software-development/20-years-trends-languages-ken-rimple/

The article discussing the past practices (~20 years ago), current trends, and future potential of software engineering and programming languages is interesting because I have only had exposure to computer science for a few years, so it is insightful to see how it has developed. It notes current norms that are important to focus on in order to succeed, such as agile methods and open source. 

The author, Ken Rimple's, consulting background also provides advice to applying software engineering in firms in any industry. For example, he recommends automating all the things (building mulit-discipline engineering teams with a variety of skills) and this technique is important for firms to continuously innovate to stay competitive in the changing world.

## Comments on the article

When the article comments about software engineering 20 years ago, it takes me a moment to remember that that was pretty much when I was born. Supercomputers didn't exist in our pockets back then like they do now, so it makes sense, as Ken Rimple notes, that the world of software development today has evolved to be more dynamic, piecemeal, and complex.
