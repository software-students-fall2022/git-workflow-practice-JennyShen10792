https://technical.ly/software-development/20-years-trends-languages-ken-rimple/

The article discussing the past practices (~20 years ago), current trends, and future potential of software engineering and programming languages is interesting because I have only had exposure to computer science for a few years, so it is insightful to see how it has developed. It notes current norms that are important to focus on in order to succeed, such as agile methods and open source. 

The author, Ken Rimple's, consulting background also provides advice to applying software engineering in firms in any industry. For example, he recommends automating all the things (building mulit-discipline engineering teams with a variety of skills) and this technique is important for firms to continuously innovate to stay competitive in the changing world.
